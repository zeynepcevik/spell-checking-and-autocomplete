# Spell Checking and Autocomplete with Binary Search Tree

The aim of this project is to develop a spell checker application that can efficiently check the spelling of words in a document. The application uses a binary search tree to store a dictionary of words and suggests corrections for misspelled words using a Levenshtein distance algorithm. Additionally, the application has an auto complete feature that suggests words based on the user's input. The program is written in Java and is capable of handling capitalization and punctuation in the input text. By the end of the project, the application will be able to read a dictionary of words from a file and build a binary search tree from it, search the binary search tree to check the spelling of words in a given document, and output the  corrected document with misspelled words highlighted
